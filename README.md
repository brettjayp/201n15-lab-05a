This is the README file for Brett Packard, Code Fellows class 201n15, lab 05a

Branched and checked out 'problem1'
Redid problem 1, acp'd, merged.

Branched and checked out 'problem2'
Redid problem 2, acp'd, merged.
Found that I made some mistakes during 'problem1' and acp'd directly to 'master', so there won't be a branch to show in GitHub. Lesson learned.
Adding this new 'README' update to 'problem1' to push it through as a branch.

Branched and checked out 'problem3'
Did problem 3, but not using previous functions, works. Now need to convert it to work using existing functions. Should be fun.
Noticed that the last problem has already been solved, don't think that was done in class. Commented out its test call, so it doesn't keep popping up in the console.
Redid problem 3 to only use previously defined functions. Problems encountered: a) named first variable 'sum' which I believe was the cause when console kept telling me something like 'sum is not a function', so I renamed it to sumabc so it wouldn't match the function, and this fixed that. b) didn't become an issue, but while working on issue a, realized I was calling the entire functions 'sum' and 'multiply', when I specifically needed the returned value of sum[0] and multipy[0], gotta remember to reference exactly what is needed! Ready to acp and merge.

Branched and checked out 'problem4'
Did problem 4. Seems very much like problem 3. Noticed that in the original setup, the argument that was given to the function was the same name as the function, rather than the testArray that it was clearly meant to be fed. Probably done that way on purpose, probably an attempt to throw people off and give them a hard time.
Problem 4 works.

Branched and checked out 'problem5'
Just like problem 4, this calls upon the same things learned in problem 3. This was almost identical to problem 4. Nothing learned doing this problem, but I would say that what was done in the previous problems was further commited to memory, and I felt very comfortable doing this one.
Oh and problem 5 works.
